# Command to create a new namespace

microk8s kubectl create ns mynamespace

#Try microk8s enable --help for a list of available services and optional features. 
microk8s disable <name> turns off a service.


# Display list of all namespaces
# namespaces: These are used to group Microservices deployed in Kubernetes

# To show the Dashboard, we need to access the Dashboard service by logging on it using token
# to receive the token, run the following command
token=$(microk8s kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep default-token | cut -d " " -f1)

- kube-system: is the namespace generated after installing MIcrok8s
# Assign the secret to kubectl so that the login can takes place

# Applying yml for deployment on Kubernetes

microk8s kubectl apply -f service.yaml

# List all pods

# To delete the service and deployment from Kubernetes run the following command

microk8s kubectl delete -f deployment.yml


# The Microk8s will provide the service details as followes
NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
aspnet-catapi-service   LoadBalancer   10.152.183.134   <pending>     8080:32201/TCP   2m49s

- NAME: is service name
- TYPE: The Access of the service
- CLUSTER-IP: The internal IP of the cluster
- EXTERNAL-AP: The IP provided by the Cluster to access service from external / puvlic clients
    - NOTE: Since Microk8s is virual env. the service will ne be allocated with External IP. You will get external IP in AKS, EKS, GKS
- PORT(S): the Port mapping of Container exposed port  (defined in service.yml)  for external communication will be mapped with the Microk8s VM port
    - 8080/32201/TCP
        - 8080 is a port used for publically accessing the Service and 32201 is a port exposed by the Microk8s to that service can be accessed using 
            - http://locahost:32201/api/[Controller]
            - OR
            - http://Kubernetes-Dashboard-IP:32201/api/[Controller] (Not receommended)
